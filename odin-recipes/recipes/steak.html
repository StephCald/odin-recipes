    <h1>Sirloin Steak with Garlic Butter</h1>
      <p>
        This sirloin steak recipe is served with very garlicky butter that makes this steak melt-in-your-mouth wonderful!
        I have never tasted any other steak that came even close to this recipe.
        If you are having steak, don't skimp on flavor to save a few calories.

   <h3><strong>Ingredients</strong></h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
        <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons garlic powder</li>
        <li>4 pounds beef top sirloin steaks</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
      </ul>

  <h3><strong>Directions</strong></h3>

  <ol>
    <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
    <li>Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; stir in minced garlic and garlic powder. Set aside.</li>
    <li>Season both sides of each steak with salt and pepper.</li>
    <li>Place steaks on preheated grill and cook 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium doneness.</li>
    <li>Transfer steaks to warmed plates; brush the tops liberally with garlic butter and allow to rest for 2 to 3 minutes before serving.</li>
  </ol>
